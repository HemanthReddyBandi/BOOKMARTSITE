# 📚 Bookmart

**Bookmart** is a full-stack e-commerce web application developed as part of my *final-year diploma project*. It showcases my skills in **full-stack web development**, featuring both frontend and backend implementations with user authentication, product management, and a shopping cart system.

## 🌐 Project Overview

Bookmart is designed to offer an intuitive and interactive platform for users to browse and manage books online.  
During its development, I gained significant experience in full-stack web technologies, improving my understanding of frontend design, backend logic, and database integration.

Originally hosted on **000webhost** (free hosting), the service was later discontinued — leading to a migration to **GitHub Pages** with an enhanced user interface (UI).  
⚠️ The GitHub Pages version does **not include a database** due to hosting limitations.
